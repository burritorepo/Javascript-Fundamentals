# Javascript - Bootcamp course notes

This work is based on Sebastian Yakibu's repo, which I modified with my own words as a way to keep all the fundamentals I learnt about during my bootcamp course.

I've included all youtube, blog posts and stack-overflow  links, I found during my bootcamp adventure, it is also a public resource to which every newcomer could have access as a reference made by a newbie for newbies.

## Getting started

You could clone this repo to your local using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/sebastian-yabiku/master-js.git
```
